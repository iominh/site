I've decided to reboot my site yet again. For a long time, I've been
admiring Octopress and kicking myself for implementing features
that are bundled with the framework. Initially I created my site using
Jekyll Bootstrap and implemented a search engine, syntax highlighting,
and lots of responsive design; all of which come free with Octopress.
